# VitalOps

VitalOps is a web application for tracking fitness workouts and weight, currently under development with Angular 21. Work in progress — core workout and weight-tracking features are implemented and being expanded.
I am trying to make a fitness tracking web application that is intended to be as simple as possible for the user while providing all the neccessary functionalities that a person who works out would want.


## Current features
- Add, delete and view workout details
- Track weight with entries and a progress chart
- User dashboard with the most important metrics that an app has
- Profile page (work in progress)

## Planned
- Nutrition tracking page
- Sleep tracking page

## Tech stack
- Angular 21
- TypeScript, HTML, CSS

## Backend
- .NET 10 Web API

## Status
Work in progress — expect improvements and new pages over time.
